Q.What is CDN?

=> CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. It is a network of servers distributed across
various geographical locations with the aim of delivering web content, such as images,
videos, scripts, and other static assets, to users more efficiently and quickly.
CDNs work by caching and distributing content to servers that are closer to the end-users,
reducing the distance that data needs to travel and improving the overall
performance of websites and applications.

Q.Why react known as React?

=> Because of its core philosophy and mechanism of efficiently updating the user interface
in response to changes in data. The name "React" reflects how the library reacts to
changes in data and automatically updates the user interface accordingly.
Declarative Approach: React uses a declarative approach to building UIs.
Instead of directly manipulating the DOM, you declare how the UI should look based on
the current state of your application.
